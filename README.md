# AI PoC for real-time animal activity recognition

## Introduction
The aim of this PoC is to allow an AI service provider to offer itâ€™s service on a public marketplace, where a service consuming party can acquire access to this offer, inject input data into it and receive predictions resulting from the inference with a trained AI model.

The AI service is providing real-time prediction and by means of having a Context Broker deployed in the offered service, the data provisioning will be in real-time from the data source(s) to the AI model and respectively publishing the results of the predictions to the consumer application via a Context Broker on the consumer side. 

## Architecure
This PoC implements the following architecture: 

![architecture](https://github.com/RihabFekii/ai-poc/blob/dev/doc/Architecture%20diagrams-Usage%20of%20AI%20service.jpg)

## Usage:

* Run the docker-compose file in smart-shepherd folder: 
```shell 
cd smart-shepherd
docker-compose up
 ```

* Run the docker-compose file in happy-cattle folder: 
```shell 
cd happy-cattle
docker-compose up
 ```


First, start with creating a subsciption from the Context Broker of Smart Shepherd to the Context Broker of Happy Cattle. This will enable Smart Shepherd to receive notification of animal coordinates update. 

* Smart Shepherd creates a subscription:
```shell
   curl -v --location --request POST 'localhost:1029/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw ' {
         "description":"Notify me of new animal coordinates",
         "type":"Subscription",
         "name":"animalCoordinatesSubscription",
         "entities":[
            {
               "type":"Animal"
            }
         ],
         "notification":{
            "endpoint":{
               "uri":"http://ai.notification-proxy.docker:8080/notification",
               "accept":"application/json"
            }
         }
      }'
  ```
* Create an entity at the Contect Broker of Happy Cattle:
```shell
   curl -v --location --request POST 'localhost:1029/ngsi-ld/v1/entities' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
         "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Animal:0001",
         "type":"Animal",
         "species":{
            "type":"Property",
            "value":"cow"
         },
         "location":{
            "type":"GeoProperty",
            "value":{
               "type":"Point",
               "coordinates":[
                  3.165,
                  2.6133,
                  -1.4292
               ]
            }
         }
      }'
```
* Query Smart Shephered Broker: 
```shell
   curl --location --request GET 'localhost:1028/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Animal:0001'
``` 

Here you should have as a result an entity of Type animal created in the Context Broker of Smart Shepherd

* Update a property in the Context Broker of Happy Cattle: 
```shell
   curl -v --location --request POST 'localhost:1029/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Animal:0001/attrs' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
         "location":{
            "type":"GeoProperty",
            "value":{
               "type":"Point",
               "coordinates":[
                  4.165,
                  3.6133,
                  -1.1292
               ]
            }
         }
      }'
```
* Query the Broker of Smart Shepehrd:
 ```shell
   curl --location --request GET 'localhost:1028/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Animal:0001'
 ```
